# UI

In **satsigner** you can develop the UI in isolation with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Run storybook

Instead of running `yarn android` or `yarn ios`, run:

```bash
yarn sb:android
yarn sb:ios
```

## Create stories

Create component stories inside the `components` folder

```
SSButton.stories.tsx
```

Follow the example story for `SSButton` above to see how you can:

1. Create different stories
2. Decorators to wrap the story
3. Define arguments and argument types
4. Define other parameters

## Controls

Storybook has stories settings where you can change the component props, change parameters, actions, etc.

Click on the bottom right icon to display these settings.

## Multiple stories vs Controls

Using the SSButton as example, it has multiple variants.

We can create just one Story and allow the storybook user to control the variant via story settings.

Or we can create multiple stories with all the variants already set for each variant.
