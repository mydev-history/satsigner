# Components

Components in **satsigner** are prefixed with "SS" so we can quickly distinguish them from other components.

## Anatomy & Best practices

The following table shows the anatomy of a **satsigner** component, from the top of the file to the bottom.

| Block of code        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imports              | Imports on the top of the file. We use path alias `@` and imports are automatically sorted using `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` |
| Prop type            | The type of the props the component will receive. Define other types above.                                                         |
| Function declaration | Declare the component function. Use object destructuring for the props and set default values.                                      |
| Constants            | Declare constants if necessary                                                                                                      |
| Hooks                | Declare hooks - hooks like useState, useMemo, useEffect come last                                                                   |
| Functions            | Use the function keyword                                                                                                            |
| Other                | Other component logic here                                                                                                          |
| Computed styles      | Styles that are conditional, based on props, are computed here                                                                      |
| Tsx                  | Return the tsx                                                                                                                      |
| Base styles          | Styles are the second to last thing                                                                                                 |
| Export               | Export the component with `export default` on the bottom of the file                                                                |

## When to create components

If you are going to write new components, first make sure if a new component is really needed or you can just place the code inside the page.
Can we reuse the component or is it big enough/has enough logic to export to a new file?
