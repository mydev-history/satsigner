# Router & Navigation

We use [expo-router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

The `app` folder serves as the file-base routing root folder for the **satsigner** mobile app.
Quickly create new pages by simply adding a file (or a folder and a file).

For example, the file `app/account/add/index.ts` will match the url `/account/add`
and `app/account/[id]/index.ts` will match the url `/account/{id}`, where `{id}` is the account id.

To navigate between pages, use the `useRouter` hook:

```tsx
const router = useRouter()

router.navigate(`/my-route`)
```

You can easily configure the Stack Screen on each page:

```tsx
<Stack.Screen
  options={{
    headerTitle: () => <SSText uppercase>{account.name}</SSText>
  }}
/>
```
